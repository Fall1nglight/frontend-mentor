## My process

### Built with

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In my opinion I have learned so much during this challenge. I had to rewrite the JavaScript part of the app a few times because I had discovered new things that could be applied. The challenge showed me another viewpoint on designing as it contains many different CSS selectors and custom styles. It was a really good practice.

### Useful resources

- [Deploying Vue App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qduayAPJK9A) - This helped me because I didn't know how to deploy a Vue app and I will use it going forward.
